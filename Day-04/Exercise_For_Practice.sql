ON o.product_id = p.product_id;

-- 2. Show all products even if they were never ordered.

SELECT p.product_name, o.order_id
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON o.product_id = p.product_id;

FROM 
orders o JOIN products p

FROM
orders o JOIN products p
ON p.product_id = o.product_id
ORDER BY p.price DESC;

-- 5. Show no. of orders placed for each product

SELECT p.product_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS revenue_per_product
FROM products p
JOIN orders o ON 
p.product_id = o.product_id

-- 7. Show products where total order revenue > ₹2000

SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.quantity * p.price) AS revenue_per_product
FROM products p

HAVING SUM(o.quantity * p.price) > 2000;
